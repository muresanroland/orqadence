# Orqadence

Drives a beads epic through a fixed multi-agent pipeline, from tickets to open pull requests, with every agent visible in herdr.

## Language

**Orqadence**:
The globally installed tool as a whole: the Orchestrator and the Shell.

**Target repo**:
The repository whose epic is being worked on. Orqadence is run from inside it; it scaffolds the repo's agent setup once, and the repo owns its conventions from then on.
_Avoid_: Project, host repo

**Stage skill**:
A skill owned and shipped by Orqadence that holds the instructions for one Stage. Once installed for a Target repo, the installed copy is the one that runs and may be edited there.
_Avoid_: Prompt, template

**Delegate skill**:
A third-party skill a Stage skill runs for one job of its Stage (test-first implementing, self review, the over-engineering audit, merge conflicts...), chosen per job by the user. A Stage can have several. The Stage skill still owns the Stage result; with no Delegate skill for a job it follows its own instructions.
_Avoid_: Override, replacement, work skill

**Shipped skill**:
Any skill Orqadence installs for a Target repo, at the Skill location: the Stage skills, plus create-pr, which the Fix Stage runs. A repo that already has a create-pr of its own is asked whether to keep it, replace it, or take the shipped one beside it as orqadence-create-pr.

**Skill manifest**:
One checkout's record of the skills Orqadence installed for it: the Shipped skills, plus third-party skills named by their source, where they were put, and which of them is each Stage's Delegate skill. It belongs to the checkout, not the repo, even when the skill files themselves are committed.
_Avoid_: Config, lockfile

**Skill location**:
Where init puts the skills Orqadence installs, as the user answers: this checkout, uncommitted (`.orqadence/skills`, linked into each Ticket's worktree); the repo, committed (`.agents/skills`); or user level (`~/.agents/skills`). A Shipped skill the repo already has in `.agents/skills` stays there.

**Epic**:
The beads epic handed to Orqadence. Its child Tickets are the whole scope of one run.

**Ticket**:
A beads issue, and the unit that moves through the Pipeline. Most are children of the Epic; a Ticket can also run on its own, whether it has an Epic or not. It ends as one pull request and closes only when that pull request is merged.
_Avoid_: Task, issue, story

**Pipeline**:
The fixed sequence of Stages every Ticket passes through: Implement, Review, Debate, Fix, then a pull request.
_Avoid_: Workflow, flow

**Round**:
One pass of Review, Debate and Fix over a Ticket. Rounds repeat until a Verdict has no fix items or the cap is reached, after which the pull request opens with any leftover Findings listed.
_Avoid_: Iteration, loop, cycle

**Stage**:
One step of the Pipeline, carried out by a fresh agent session in its own pane.
_Avoid_: Step, phase

**App**:
An agent CLI a Stage can run on, such as claude or codex, picked per Stage by the user. Each App starts its own sessions, reads the Target repo's skills, and has its own usage limits.
_Avoid_: Agent, kind, CLI, provider

**Stage result**:
The recorded outcome of a Stage, carrying its completion status and, as appropriate, Findings, a Verdict, an opened pull request, a Plan to approve, or a question the Stage needs the user to answer before it can go on. The Orchestrator uses it together with the session's state to decide whether the Stage can advance.

**Run directory**:
The Ticket's directory under `.orqadence/runs/`, holding its Stages' evidence: the result files, diffs and Debate transcripts, all flat text. It doubles as the Review's sandbox, so the checkout's skills are linked there and build scratch lands there too, both pruned when the pull request opens.
_Avoid_: Logs, workdir, artifacts

**Finding**:
One claimed problem with a Ticket's changes, raised by the Review or by the over-engineering audit, and the unit the Debate argues over.
_Avoid_: Comment, issue, point

**Moderator**:
The neutral session that runs the Debate between side A and side B. It never argues a position of its own, and settles Findings the sides still dispute by an outside score.
_Avoid_: Judge, Debby

**Verdict**:
The Debate's result: every Finding marked fix or skip, with a severity and the reason. Only fix items reach the Fix Stage.
_Avoid_: Synthesis, summary, report

**Epic summary**:
The Shell's read-only page over one Epic's run: each Ticket's pull request, Rounds and Findings fixed, skipped and left on the pull request, then the Parked Tickets with their reasons. It opens by itself once every Ticket has its pull request or is Parked, and /summary opens it again, built fresh from bd, the state file and the Run directories.
_Avoid_: Report, recap

**Wake**:
The Orchestrator's request for judgment about a Stage that cannot advance by rule, answered by a Judgment or, failing that, by the user through a Question.
_Avoid_: Alert, escalation

**Nudge**:
One canned prompt sent into a woken Stage's live session, at most once per session, by a Judgment or the user's answer: **write the result**, when the work is done but the result file is not, or **carry on**, when the session stopped to ask and nobody will answer, so it decides for itself.
_Avoid_: Continue (that is /continue, resuming a saved run), poke, reminder

**Judgment**:
The Orchestrator's answer to a Wake or a Plan, taken from a typed model over the evidence: for a Wake one of a fixed set of actions with a score each, for a Plan a yes or no score on each criterion (it covers the Ticket, it stays in scope, it asks the user a question). It is acted on at or above a confidence floor, a Wake's and a Plan's each kept in config.json, and shown on the Shell.
_Avoid_: LLM call, Main session

**Plan**:
What an Implement session writes before it may edit: the changes and tests it intends for its Ticket, the decisions it made with the answer taken, and an open question only when it has one. A Judgment approves it when it covers every acceptance criterion, stays in scope and asks nothing; otherwise the user reads it and answers, and the session revises it. An open question always goes to the user.

**Question**:
What the Shell puts to the user when the Orchestrator cannot act alone: a Wake the Judgment was unsure about, a blocked session, a plan to approve, a Stage's own question, the Review's App at its usage limit, or a confirmation. It holds only its Ticket (the Review's limit, every Ticket reaching the Review on that App until it is answered), is answered from a fixed set of options or a line of the user's own text, and is never saved: on resume it is derived again from the live session or the Stage result.
_Avoid_: Prompt, dialog, alert, form, popup

**Parked**:
A Ticket taken out of the Pipeline to wait for the user, after a Wake that a Judgment or the user settled as park, or after its Stage asked a question while the user was Away. Other Tickets keep running.
_Avoid_: Stuck, paused, failed

**Away**:
What the user declares in the Shell when nobody will answer for a while, such as overnight. A Stage's question then parks its Ticket instead of waiting, and is put to the user when they continue that Ticket. Nothing else changes: Judgments still answer what they can.
_Avoid_: AFK, offline, unattended mode

**Limited**:
A Ticket held because the App its Stage runs on hit its provider's usage limit. The limit holds every Stage on that App, whichever Ticket it belongs to: a short one resumes at the reset; a long one (a reset more than a day away) ends the run with every session saved, and /continue resumes each where it stopped. A limit on the Review is put to the user once, through a Question whose answer stands for every Ticket until the reset; a limit on one Debate side settles the Findings without that side. Unlike Parked, nothing in the Ticket's own work went wrong.
_Avoid_: Rate-limited, cooling down, throttled

**Ticket tab**:
The herdr tab belonging to one running Ticket, holding one pane per Stage.

**Tools**:
The one seam every external command (herdr, bd, gh, git) goes through; a test double stands behind it so tests never start a process.
_Avoid_: Runner, exec, shell

**Orchestrator**:
The deterministic process that owns ticket state, pane placement, and stage transitions. Its only judgment calls are bounded, logged Judgments through a typed model, and it never composes text.
_Avoid_: Script, runner, daemon

**Shell**:
The full-terminal screen that `orqa` alone opens: it lists the Epics and the open Tickets with no Epic, takes slash commands, runs the Orchestrator inside its own process, and is where every event and Question appears.
_Avoid_: TUI, dashboard, Main session, attach
