//! Plans (harness-7bj.9, research/plan-mode): Implement starts in plan mode
//! with a hook that copies every plan it presents into the run directory as
//! plan.md. Blocked at the plan dialog with a plan newer than the last judged
//! is a plan ready. The dialog is answered by keys, and only on what the pane
//! shows: enter on a Yes approves; feedback moves the cursor down, a key a
//! call, to "Tell Claude what to change", enters it empty, and goes in as a
//! prompt. esc and 3 are never sent: in the research they approved.
//!
//! A split (harness-7nq.8, research/stage-models) plans on one model and
//! implements on another: opusplan, its halves remapped in the settings,
//! which show the dialog's clear-context option; approval moves there, so
//! the implementing model starts from the plan alone.
//!
//! Off claude (harness-7nq.12) the Plan takes two steps: the session writes
//! plan.md and a Stage result STATUS: plan, and waits. Feedback goes into
//! its pane as a prompt; approval prompts "implement the approved plan",
//! only while the worktree is as the session found it: a session that
//! changed it before approval is a plan failure.
