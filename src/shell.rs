//! The Shell: the full-terminal screen that `orqa` alone opens (ADR 0004).
//! `Screen` is the plain state the tests drive; `open` wraps it in the
//! terminal and the one draw, poll and tick loop (ADR 0003). The Shell owns
//! the Orchestrator: the scheduler runs on a thread of this process, its
//! Events come over a channel into RECENT and the log, and the TICKETS rows
//! are a snapshot of its State. An Event that asks (a Wake, a blocked
//! session) becomes a Question, whose answer goes back to the Orchestrator
//! for that session; the Orchestrator knows no Shell type.
