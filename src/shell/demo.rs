//! /demo: a scripted run on a made-up Epic, to see what a live run looks

# Plan: Retry failed uploads

## Changes
- `upload::send` retries a failed chunk up to 3 times, backing off 1s, 2s, 4s
- a chunk that still fails marks the upload failed and names the chunk

## Tests
- a chunk failing twice, then passing, uploads whole
- a chunk failing four times fails the upload, naming the chunk

## Decisions
- Retries live in `send`, not its callers: every upload path gets them
- The backoff is fixed: nobody has asked to tune it
