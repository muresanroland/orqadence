# Agent Instructions

There is no CLAUDE.md: Claude Code reads this file. `bd setup claude` would
write one back, so don't run it here. The Beads block below is managed by
`bd setup`; edit the sections above it.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Build and test

Rust, edition 2021, rust-version 1.89. Crates: serde, serde_json, regex, chrono, crossterm, ratatui, ureq; anything else needs a ticket.

```bash
cargo build --release               # the binary at target/release/orqa; skills/ is read with include_str!
cargo check                         # typecheck; cargo clippy too if installed
cargo test                          # all tests; cargo test <name> for one
```

- `src/main.rs`: entry point. `src/cli.rs`: `orqa` alone opens the Shell; `orqa init` and `--version` are the only commands. `src/shell.rs`: the Shell, which owns the Orchestrator in-process and takes the slash commands (/start-epic, /start-ticket, /continue, /stop-work, /retry, /park, /rebase, /address-pr-comments, /questions, /manual-work, /brainstorm, /away, /exit); `src/shell/idea.rs` /brainstorm's idea modal, Ctrl+G's editor and Start; `src/shell/draw.rs` the layout. `src/setup.rs`: `orqa init` and preflight. `src/orchestrator/`: stage, pipeline, scheduler, pr (the PR poll's GraphQL reply: quiet head, open items), state, herdr, result, trust. `src/tools.rs`: the seam to every external tool (herdr, bd, gh, git), and the Editor seam beside it that runs Ctrl+G's editor in the terminal. `src/skills.rs`: the shipped skills via `include_str!`; `src/skills/manifest.rs` the Skill manifest, fetching a skill with git, the jobs' suggestions and the listing of skills you have. `src/update.rs`: silent self-update from GitHub Releases, and the prices of the models in use from LiteLLM's catalog, kept in `.orqadence-local/prices.json` for the Epic summary. `src/graphify.rs`: the Shell's graphify pass at open and every 24h (the checkout's code graph, graphify's upgrade, the newest vX.Y.Z tag) and the Docs pass on a new X.Y tag (its Question, then graphify's skill in a herdr tab labelled graphify), the last X.Y it handled in `.orqadence-local/graphify-docs-pass`. `src/on_call.rs`: On call's Moshi doorbell and the per-person On call settings in `.orqadence-local/config.json`. `src/brainstorm.rs`: the Brainstorm's brainstorm:* labels, its state in `.orqadence-local/brainstorms/<idea>/state.json`, and which bd issues are a Map, a Waypoint or an Idea, kept out of TICKETS and the Pipeline. `src/brainstorm/driver.rs`: the Brainstorm's driver, its session in a pane split from the Shell's on a thread of its own, its result file checked in bd and acted on. `src/brainstorm/research.rs`: the live Map's research in the background, each Research Waypoint the research Stage of the Brainstorm's own Orchestrator in tab research-<map>, max_research at once. `skills/`: the SKILL.md files, one Stage skill per Stage plus create-pr, infra-review (orqa:infra's Extra review), address-pr-comments (the PR comments job's default), manual-work, the Brainstorm skills brainstorm-chart (an Idea into a Map or Tickets), brainstorm-epic (a Map's build Epics), brainstorm-waypoint and brainstorm-research, and brainstorm-grilling and brainstorm-domain-modeling (which every Brainstorm skill loads), whose fetch.sh, scripts/threads.sh, template.sh, ADR-FORMAT.md, CONTEXT-FORMAT.md, LOGIC.md and UI.md ship beside them through `EXTRA_FILES`.
- Tests are in-crate `#[cfg(test)]` modules, one file per area (`src/<area>/<name>_test.rs`). Tests substitute the fake behind the Tools seam; `src/orchestrator/world.rs` fakes a whole herdr/bd/gh world and never starts real sessions, and `src/shell/shell_test.rs` drives the Shell's command handlers over it without a terminal.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in beads (`bd`), not GitHub Issues. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five default triage roles, each a bd label of the same name. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/core-concepts/sync-concepts.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
